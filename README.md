# timetracker

***WORK IN PROGRESS****

*This project serves as a refactoring exercise. I've been doing TDD without refactoring after each green test, which has resulted in a fun mess with which I could practice refactoring.*

A command line time tracker written as a Ruby gem. Inspired by [Watson](https://tailordev.github.io/Watson/).
